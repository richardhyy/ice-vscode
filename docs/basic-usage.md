# Basic Usage

## Instant Chat

1. Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS)
2. Type "Instant Chat" (you don't have to type the whole thing, it should autocomplete)
3. If the "ICE: New Instant Chat" command is highlighted, press `Enter`
4. You can now select a chat provider and start chatting! (API keys required)

**Note:** You can continue a previous Instant Chat session by running "ICE: Continue Last Instant Chat" from the Command Palette.

If you've enabled the `Use Previous Provider For New Chat` setting, ICE will automatically select your previously used provider when starting a new chat.

## Managing Chat Sessions as `.chat` Files

1. Create a new file with a `.chat` extension (e.g., `my_conversation.chat`)
2. Open the file
3. Select a chat provider to start (API keys required)
